# Carrier Screening

Introduction:

While this project was started for practice in analyzing variant data from public genomic datasets, it is aimed to dig into available genomic data to see if anything can be found to impove the state of carrier screening. 

Currenlty, it is estimated that 10% of the global population may be affected by a rare disease. Of these rare diseases, a portion of them are autosomal recessive conditions that may be detected during carrier screening. Unfortunately, it is possible that deleterious variants for a rare recessive disorder is missed primarily becauses existing tests only cover a short list of pathogenic variants, are not useful for identifying new varaints or have not historically been used for individuals of all ancestries. Furhtermore, these tests do not cover variant where there is insufficient data in terms of their pathogenicity. Thus, based on current guidelines, some pathogenic variants will be missed and other, variants of uncertain significance, may not be reported back to the couple undergoing testing. 

Since what is known about carrier frequencies on given disease is usually restricited by ancestry, this project is to take a all available data on a handful of major genes and work through the prevalence across all people as opposed to a few.
